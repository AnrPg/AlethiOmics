Genes.species_taxon_iri as FOREIGN KEY reference should be one of the iris in taxa array
Genes.pathway_iri         VARCHAR(255)     NULL COMMENT 'Link to KEGG/Reactome',
Genes.go_terms            TEXT             NULL COMMENT 'Pipe-separated GO IDs',

mk_gene_catalog() shouldn't create fake genes but rather open one of the zarr files and take all gene names there so that we're sure genes are in humans (names need harmonization though)

For Microbe table:
culture_collection
genome_assembly_accession
habitat
optimal_growth_temp DECIMAL(4,1)
doubling_time DECIMAL(5,2)
metabolic_profile_iri

collection_date should get the date of study from study_iri and add one, two or four dates (random choice)

response_marker for SampleStimulus

mk_..._catalog functions should return a list with what the id of the catalog they created. if needed, they could return a list with the whole objects or just an id/iri
